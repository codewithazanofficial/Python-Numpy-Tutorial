This is a Full-Fledge-Numpy-Python tutorial
I created it personally as I was also learning numpy few months ago and watching different and research i practiced a lot and finally created this notebook.
In this notebook there are all significant numpy functions that can be important 
Some of them are 
ar.reshape
ar.ravel
ar.size
ar.shape
ar.dtype
ar.argmax()
ar.argmim()
ar.argsort()
ar.empty()
ar.identity()
